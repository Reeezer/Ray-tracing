Ray-tracing

The Ray-tracing project focuses on simulating the behavior of light rays as they interact with different surfaces such as walls, mirrors, and transparent materials, allowing for the visualization of reflections and refractions.

Using a particle-based approach, the project launches rays from a source and traces their paths as they encounter various objects in the scene. By accurately modeling the physics of light, the simulation can simulate realistic effects such as reflection and refraction, providing a visually immersive experience.
